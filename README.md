# Data Analysis Portfolio
This portfolio contains the projects I have worked on during my data analysis course. It also includes a personal project that I have chosen to work on to practice new methods and tools.
### Why HTML?
I chose to build this portfolio using HTML because it allowed me to learn and practice a new language on my own.
It also provided me with a way to showcase my projects and present them in an organized and visually appealing manner.
HTML is a widely used language for building websites and having this skill is valuable in a variety of fields.
